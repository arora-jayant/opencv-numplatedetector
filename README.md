Depending on where you live, you may have seen speed cameras that take pictures of your car if you’re going above the posted speed limit (image above) or license plate cameras on toll roads. Imagine taking photos of every car that speeds by and then manually writing out the car’s license plate number so that you can issue a ticket. This would be a pretty tedious process. Luckily, we have systems that have automated this entire process, and I replicated a system that detects and scans car number plates with OpenCV through Python.
